/**
 This class handles primitive conveniences for loading and saving a dictionary to the app's 
 local file system.
 
 It also contains a high level interface for finding values for keys,
 so that one needn't access the underlying dictionary directly.
 
 We are meant to be subclassed, so that your subclass can provide a curated API for its 
 collaborators to use.
 
 The central goal of this class is to provide a simple interface that abstracts you from the
 mechanics of reading and writing an NSDictionary to the file system.
 
 For deciding on whether to use the Documents directory, Library Directory etc., please see Apple's guide:
 
 https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/FileSystemOverview/FileSystemOverview.html

 When not specified, we default to using the Application Support directory.
